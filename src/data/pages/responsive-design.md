The number of web-accessible devices is staggeringly wonderful. This can be a daunting canvas for design without a modern responsive approach. I specialise in embracing the web's ubiquity. It's my job to design for all experiences because successful websites remain accessible to the whole audience.

My web design process is heavily feedback driven. It allows for the best collaboration between all parties; myself and other developers, website stateholders, and the eventual end-users.

## Your website

Great design that _works_ can't be achieved in isolation. How does it work for your business? We'll figure that out in the browser as the website evolves.

We'll discuss: content, information architecture, business requirements, brand values, user stories, user experience — everything that defines a successful website. All the while testing and experiencing the design on our favourite devices.

It's a fluid, adaptive process.
